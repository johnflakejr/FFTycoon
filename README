For your offseason.

If you're like me, you pour a significant amount of time into Fantasy Football during the season...but how can we scratch that itch in the offseason?

In this game, you are Jimmy Football.  You are Joe Six-Pack.  You are the league manager for a fantasy football team destined for greatness. 

Because of legal reasons, the player names are fake.  The teams are fake.  It's all made up and just for fun.  

Draft your team, play some rounds, and relax.
